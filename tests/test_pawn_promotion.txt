// Test file for pawn promotion
// This file tests promotion of pawns when they reach the opposite end of the board

// Setting up a scenario where a pawn can be promoted
// We'll create a direct path for a pawn to quickly reach promotion

// Move 1: White pawn from e2 to e4
e2 e4

// Move 1: Black pawn from d7 to d5
d7 d5

// Move 2: White pawn from e4 captures black pawn on d5
e4 d5

// Move 2: Black knight from b8 to c6
b8 c6

// Move 3: White pawn from d5 to d6
d5 d6

// Move 3: Black knight from g8 to f6
g8 f6

// Move 4: White pawn from d6 to d7
d6 d7

// Move 4: Black bishop from c8 to e6
c8 e6

// Move 5: White pawn from d7 captures on e8, promoting to a queen
d7 e8

// Expected result: White pawn should be promoted to a queen on e8

// Now let's test another promotion scenario, but from Black's perspective

// Move 5: Black pawn from c7 to c5
c7 c5

// Move 6: White bishop from f1 to b5
f1 b5

// Move 6: Black pawn from c5 to c4
c5 c4

// Move 7: White bishop from b5 to a4

// Move 8: Black pawn from c3 captures on b2
c3 b2

// Move 9: White knight from g1 to f3
